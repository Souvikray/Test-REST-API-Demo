This repository is an extension of my **REST-API-Demo** repository to which I have also included the test suite which does three kind of tests namely **Unit Tests**, **Integration Tests** and **System Tests**.This ensures that the application is fully functional and shows the expected behaviour.Further more I have linked it to **Travis CI** to automate the testing.

Below is the screenshot of the application where I have performed the Unit testing, Integration testing and System testing which in total are 32 tests.
